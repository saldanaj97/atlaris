## Subscription Tiers

Access to models is gated by your subscription tier:

- **Free Tier**: Users on the free plan have access to all models marked as `free`. This includes high-performance models like Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude Haiku 4.5.
- **Pro Tier**: Pro subscribers have access to the entire catalog, including premium models like Claude Sonnet 4.5 and the latest GPT-5 variants.

## Understanding Costs

Costs are listed per million (M) tokens:

- **Input Cost**: The cost for the prompt/instructions sent to the model.
- **Output Cost**: The cost for the response generated by the model.

Models marked with `$0/M` are free to use for all users within their respective tier quotas.

## Technical Specifications

### Context Window

The context window represents the maximum amount of text (in tokens) the model can "remember" or process at once.

- **Large Context (1M+ tokens)**: Best for complex learning plans with extensive notes or large amounts of reference material.
- **Standard Context (128K - 400K tokens)**: Suitable for most general-purpose learning plan generations.

### Providers

We integrate with multiple top-tier AI providers via OpenRouter to ensure high availability and access to the latest advancements in LLM technology:

- **Google**: Known for massive context windows and fast "Flash" models.
- **Anthropic**: Renowned for nuanced reasoning and safety.
- **OpenAI**: Industry standard for general-purpose intelligence and multimodal capabilities.
- **Alibaba**: Specialized models for deep research and analysis.

## Model Selection

Users can select their preferred model in the **Settings > AI Configuration** section of the application. The selected model will be used for all subsequent learning plan generations, provided it is within the user's subscription tier.
