/**
 * POST /api/v1/ai/enhance-content (future)
 *  Purpose: Apply targeted AI enhancements to existing plan content WITHOUT full regeneration.
 *  Potential enhancement types:
 *    - 'improve_descriptions' (rewrite module/task descriptions for clarity)
 *    - 'add_practice_tasks' (append tasks focused on hands-on learning)
 *    - 'tighten_scope' (reduce total volume based on updated weekly hours)
 *
 *  Flow (pending design):
 *    1. Validate enhancement_type & optional scope (moduleId / taskId).
 *    2. Insert enhancement job row (plan_enhancements) with status='pending'.
 *    3. Enqueue worker job performing selective modifications (version fields or patch table).
 *    4. Return 202 { enhancementId }.
 *
 *  Open questions:
 *    - Should enhancements be versioned & revertible per task/module?
 *    - Conflict resolution if regeneration occurs mid-enhancement.
 *
 *  MVP decision: Defer implementation until baseline plan lifecycle is stable.
