/**
 * POST /api/v1/plans/:planId/regenerate (future)
 *  Flow concept (async similar to initial plan creation):
 *    1. Validate ownership & that current status is 'ready' (avoid overlapping generations) unless forced.
 *    2. Insert row into plan_generations history table with status='pending', capture parameters overrides.
 *    3. Enqueue regeneration job referencing generationId + planId.
 *    4. Option A response: 202 { generationId, planId, status:'pending' }.
 *    5. Worker: generate new modules/tasks -> either:
 *         a) Replace existing modules/tasks (destructive) OR
 *         b) Append new version & mark previous as archived (versioned approach) (TBD decision).
 *    6. Update plan + history row to status='ready' (or 'failed').
 *    7. Optional: diff summary stored for UI preview before applying destructive change (if implementing a two-step confirm UX later).
 *
 *  Idempotency: Consider a short-lived idempotency key to prevent duplicate regenerations on double-clicks.
 *  Rate limiting: Stricter than create to prevent abuse (e.g., 3/min per plan).
 *  Observability: Capture tokens_used, model_version, duration_ms for analytics/billing.
